### The **_demo.py_** Python script and the **_my_marc_recs_in.mrc_** file of sample MARC records are both needed to perform the hands-on exercises.  To download the files, you need to click on "presentations" (above) and then click the "Download ZIP" button on the bottom right side of the "presentations" page.  You should then find the .zip file in your local Downloads.
